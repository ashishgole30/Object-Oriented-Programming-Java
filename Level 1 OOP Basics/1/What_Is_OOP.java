         * DEFINITION:
         * OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects and classes,
         * which contain both data and methods, making programs modular, reusable, and
         * easy to maintain.
         */

        /*
         * CORE IDEA:
         * OOP organizes code into:
         * Data (variables)
         * Behavior (methods/functions)
         * And binds them together into a single unit called an object.
         */

        /*
         * NEED:
         * 1️⃣ To Model Real-World Problems
         * 2️⃣ To Make Code Organized
         * 3️⃣ To Improve Reusability
         * 4️⃣ To Improve Security
